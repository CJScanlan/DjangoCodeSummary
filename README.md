Code Summary for Tech Academy Python live project

# About
After finishing up the Python coursework at the Tech Academy, I worked on a team for two weeks developing a web application utilizing Django Framework. The application consists of a wide array of different hobbies, in which each sub-app focuses on a different hobby of choice. 
My app focused on hiking. I created a database for hiking trails, which allowed the user to create, edit, store, and delete trails from anywhere in the US. Trails are displayed with their name, location, length, level of difficulty, an image, and a description. I also included a search feature, allowing the user to search for trails by name or location. 
This was a great opportunity to learn the Django Framework, and become accustomed to solving and debugging issues.
